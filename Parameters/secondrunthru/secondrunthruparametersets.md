# AI Optimization Parameter Sets

This document describes 10 new parameter sets (Parameter Sets A to P) developed to expand upon the best-performing parameter set from previous testing. Each set aims to fine-tune the AI's strategy to achieve even better performance.

## Parameter Set A: Increase Aggression
**Strategy**: Hyper-Aggressive Capturing: Further prioritizes capturing opponent pieces and setting up potential captures.

## Parameter Set B: Enhance Mobility
**Strategy**: Superior Flexibility: Values having more legal moves, allowing the AI to respond to threats and opportunities more effectively.

## Parameter Set C: Balance Aggression and Defense
**Strategy**: Balanced Playstyle: Aims to maintain aggression while ensuring the AI doesn't overextend and leave itself vulnerable.

## Parameter Set D: Focus on Middle Control
**Strategy**: Dominant Central Control: Prioritizes occupying and controlling central positions, potentially enhancing both offense and defense.

## Parameter Set E: Reduce Largest Stack Penalty
**Strategy**: Strategic Stack Building: Less penalty for large stacks may lead the AI to create powerful stacks for offensive or defensive purposes.

## Parameter Set F: Increase Largest Stack Bonus
**Strategy**: Stack Advantage: Encourages the AI to build and maintain large stacks, potentially dominating key areas.

## Parameter Set G: Adjust Game Stage Depths
**Strategy**: Deeper Analysis: Allows the AI to look further ahead, potentially making more informed decisions.

## Parameter Set H: Decrease Time Limits
**Strategy**: Quick Decision-Making: Forces the AI to make faster decisions, testing its efficiency under pressure.

## Parameter Set I: Adjust Game Stage Thresholds
**Strategy**: Adaptive Strategy Shift: Changes the AI's strategic focus earlier in the game.

## Parameter Set J: Emphasize Own Pieces
**Strategy**: Aggressive Yet Protective: Maintains an aggressive approach while placing more emphasis on preserving own pieces.

## Parameter Set K: Decrease Middle Control Emphasis
**Strategy**: Flexible Positioning: May explore opportunities across the board rather than focusing heavily on central control.

## Parameter Set L: Increase Penalty for Large Stacks
**Strategy**: Avoiding Vulnerabilities: Discourages the formation of large stacks, reducing the risk of significant losses.

## Parameter Set M: Emphasize Potential Captures Even More
**Strategy**: Capture Setup Specialist: Prioritizes setting up situations that can lead to captures in subsequent moves.

## Parameter Set N: Reduce Importance of Own Pieces
**Strategy**: Sacrificial Aggression: May be more willing to sacrifice pieces for strategic gains.

## Parameter Set O: Adjust Mobility and Captured Balance
**Strategy**: Capture-Focused Play: Greater emphasis on capturing over maintaining high mobility.

## Parameter Set P: Combine Multiple Adjustments
**Strategy**: Optimized Aggression with Depth: Enhances the aggressive strategy with deeper analysis and adjusted weights.
